# Credit-Risk-Resampling

Credit risk poses a classification problem that’s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Instructions:

This challenge consists of the following subsections: 


## 1) Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

## 2) Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

## 3) Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

## 4) Results

The logistic regression model predicts healthy loans at 100% and high-risk loans at 84%. The model can definitely be used to predict healthy loans, but is a bit risky for high-risk loans.
